# HoP Session Minutes (04/11/20) â€“ Term 4/6 2020

Prior to the HoP session, HoP was provided with the [consolidated feedback](https://sutdapac-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jeremy_chew_mymail_sutd_edu_sg/EdUQ_yusZ0RElNUfMXgOSi4B6bx3BVKkkCRnZXoc39H32Q?e=AcOlL4) from students, collected by the ISTD Student Board.

## Issues raised

### Term 4 Mods

**Intro to Algo**

- Insufficient support materials
  - Instructors also do not set aside any session to review materials live with students
  - Suggested to have a similar arrangement to Infosys, where the first two sessions are recorded lectures, and the third session would be a cohort session to review material
- Between the last feedback (in 2019) and now, the only difference is that homework are longer
  - Commented that the new homework are harder than the problem sets
  - Looking for more practical, implementation-based problems
- Suggested to tailor the course to include algorithm design (problem-solving), on top of understanding the existing algorithms
- Commented that mid-term exam duration (1h) was too short, 1.5h would make it more manageable

*Responses*

- Prof Tony wondered if the current arrangement was due to Covid, and if it would improve if things were back to normal
  - Students shared that instructors also used the cohort session as a lecture session instead of a tutorial during the previous batch
- Prof Tony will communicate to the instructors to use the cohort session as a tutorial session, used to discuss/review material

**Comp Struc**

- Workload is too high
- Commented that mid-term exam duration (1h) was too short, 1.5h would make it more manageable

*Responses*

- Prof Tony mentioned that the nature of the courses meant a relatively high workload, otherwise students would not be able to learn anything
- Prof Tony also suggested that students make use of any learning opportunities (such as coaching sessions) in order to help revise and understand the material

### Term 6 Mods

**Database and Big Data**

- Over-usage of TA
  - Questions were redirected to the TA, who also appeared lost at times
- Required to watch a 3h-long video
- Comments on the weightage of various components
  - Quiz vs project
    - 10% for each quiz is not very reasonable, considering that the project is 25%
  - Also commented that quiz 1 was way too hard compared to what was taught
  - Project's scope is way too large for 25%
- Lack practice materials
  - Instructor did not release answers for the quiz, and students had to refer back to the 3h lecture
- Too much theory and too little application
- Suggested that the mod be split into 2 separate modules, DB and Big Data

*Responses*

- Prof Tony would allow the instructor to focus on his area of expertise in the future, instead of needing to teach this mod
- Under consideration to remove the Big Data section of the mod
- Consider adjusting final exam arrangements and weightages

**CDS**

- Labs not well-organised
- Goal of CDS not well-understood, ML seems to overlap a lot with CDS
- Also, instructors seem to assume students are doing ML even when it is not a co/pre-requisite course
- Suggested to frame CDS as the applied component of ML instead (ML will teach the theory, CDS will teach how to use said theory)
- CDS project is vague and feedback is insufficient

**Machine Learning**

- Lectures were recorded but not released
- Prepared notes were good, but delivery of content could be better
- Questioned the need for the annotation of 500 documents

*Responses*

- Lecture recordings were eventually released
- Prof Tony will inform the instructor to have a smaller data set for annotation in the future (to at least give some experience of annotating)

### Others

**Mid-term survey**
- Some courses didn't open the mid-term survey
  - Comp Struc instructors had to make a special request to eDimension team to actually open up the survey

*Responses*

- Prof Tony suggested to have mid-term survey open for all ISTD modules, and Felice would help inform the relevant personel for note in the future.

### **Course Delivery and Content**

- Suggested to QC courses to help improve course content and delivery

## Other stuff

**Pillar Name**
- Some students asked why not Computer Science and Design
  - Differentiation from other CS schools
  - Possible accreditation requirements
- University proposed Computing Systems and Design, which many felt is unsuitable due to the lack of any reference point
- Re-open a new poll to gauge student response towards the name change, what name would be good, and why.
