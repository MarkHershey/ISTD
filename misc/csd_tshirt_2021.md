# CSD T-shirt Design Contest 2021

In light of the degree name change from _ISTD (Information System Technology and Design)_ to **CSD (Computer Science and Design)**, we are going to design a new CSD T-shirt!

We encourage you to submit your design to us, and we will get everyone to vote for their favorite one. The winning T-shirt will be produced and distributed to every CSD student/staff, and the winner will walk away with a cash prize and hopefully a great sense of accomplishment!
