## Current Initiatives

### I3 Lab Furnishing 

The I3 Lab is conceptualised to serve the needs of the students by providing resources, such as physical space and hosting (VM) services for student projects. It will also serve as an to showcase student projects and conduct outreach.

We are looking for additional students to help steer the furnishing for the lab and assist with two simple "seed" projects to be showcased in the lab:

* **IoT Sensor Pod + Live Dashboard**
  
  Build a live web dashboard to showcase sensor readings from across the school, relayed via the SigFox platform

* **Turtlebot Remote Operation + Computer Vision demo**

  Build a demo setup to be used during outreach or open house for visitors to drive the Turtlebot and see Computer Vision in action (e.g. object detection)
  
If you're interested to participate, please contact `timothy_liu[at]mymail.sutd.edu.sg`.

### SUTD Compute JupyterHub

ISTD Student Board is working with Temasek Labs to host a small GPU cluster of 10+ GPUs. We have run some smaller scale proof of concepts previously but are now working to set up a "proper" cluster that will serve ISTD students.

If you're interested to participate, please contact `timothy_liu[at]mymail.sutd.edu.sg`.
